This repository contains code for analyzing agricultural fields using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The code performs various tasks, including crop type classification, time series analysis of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and creation of GIF animations for visualizing temporal changes in NDVI.
